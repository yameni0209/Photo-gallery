Architectural Document: Online Photo Gallery

Overview

The online photo gallery is a web application that allows users to view and filter photos based on categories. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This document outlines the architectural design of the application.

Components

Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It consists of the following components:HTML Structure: The HTML structure is defined in a single index.html file, which contains the markup for the photo grid, category filters, and image modal.
CSS Styles: The CSS styles are defined in a single styles.css file, which contains the layout, typography, and color scheme for the application.
Business Logic Layer: The business logic layer is responsible for handling the application's logic, including filtering photos based on categories. It consists of the following components:JavaScript Code: The JavaScript code is defined in a single script.js file, which contains the logic for filtering photos, displaying image modals, and handling user interactions.
Data Layer: The data layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data for the application. Since this application does not require a back-end, the data layer consists of a local data store:Local Data Store: The local data store is a JavaScript object that stores the photo data, including image URLs, captions, and categories.
System Architecture

The system architecture is a client-side architecture, where all the logic and data are stored on the client-side (i.e., the browser).

Component Interactions

The components interact with each other as follows:

The presentation layer receives user input (e.g., clicking on a category filter) and sends it to the business logic layer.
The business logic layer processes the user input and updates the local data store accordingly.
The business logic layer retrieves the updated data from the local data store and sends it to the presentation layer.
The presentation layer receives the updated data and renders the updated user interface.
Data Flow

The data flow is as follows:

The local data store is initialized with photo data, including image URLs, captions, and categories.
The business logic layer retrieves the photo data from the local data store and filters it based on the user's selection.
The filtered photo data is sent to the presentation layer, which renders the updated photo grid.
Security Considerations

Since this application does not require a back-end, there are no security considerations related to server-side data storage or authentication. However, the application should still follow best practices for client-side security, such as:

Validating user input to prevent XSS attacks.
Using HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
I can help you with the implementation of the online photo gallery. Would you like me to provide the code for the project?
